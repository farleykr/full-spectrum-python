        <h3>Full Spectrum Python aims to be…</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A free resource for Python practitioners from any area of expertise and of any skill level to find the tools they need </li>  
  
          <li>A loop of continuous feedback and re-iteration based on said feedback will ensure that FSP is what the community needs it to be</li> 
      
          <li>Curated to include only premier resources that have been vetted by the community and stand as the best examples of their type</li> 
        
          <li>Free of accounts or any form of sign up.  You may supply your email address if you explicitly volunteer it and it will only be used for updates regarding FSP and never to get you to buy anything or involve you in anything else requiring money for that matter.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <h3>If you’re still reading,</h3>
